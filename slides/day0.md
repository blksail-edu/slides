# Final Project

## Objective
The goal of the final project is to make an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can navigate in the pool and perform a series of tasks.


## Challenge
The theme of the challenge is inspired by the book _"The Hunt for Red October"_.

Teams will be divided into two groups:
- **Prey**: the prey team will be hiding in the pool
- **Hunter**: the hunter team will be looking for the prey

- 📊 **Progress**: You will be presenting your progress at the end of each day

As a team, you will be responsible for:
- Defining the tasks and objectives of your AUV
- Developing the software to control your AUV
- Testing your AUV in the pool
- Presenting your AUV to the class
