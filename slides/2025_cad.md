# What is CAD?

CAD stands for **Computer-Aided Design**.

Engineers use CAD every day to design and visualize parts and systems.

- Onshape, Solidworks, Fusion360, Siemens NX, etc.

Extremely useful for dimensioning, tolerances, and assemblies.

# What is a Part Studio?

A part studio is a CAD environment for the design of a single part.

Let‚Äôs take a look at a part studio from one of my combat robots.

# What is an Assembly?

An assembly is a CAD environment that contains multiple part studios.

Assemblies are especially helpful to visualize the interactions between parts.
- Includes the creation of mates
- We can mate parts together (fastened, planar, revolve, etc.)

Let‚Äôs take a look at an assembly from one of my combat robots.

# Additive Manufacturing

Additive manufacturing is a type of manufacturing that layers materials to create a part.

# Designing for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM)

CADing and DfAM are not necessarily the same.

Take a look at our submarine:
